### Email System Debugging & Fixes ✅ COMPLETED

**Fixed - Weekly Digest & Daily User Engagement Emails**

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified why weekly digest and daily user engagement emails weren't sending
  - **Weekly Digest Issue**: Function was returning early if no apps had vibes, sending NO emails to anyone
  - **Daily User Emails Issue**: Lacked visibility into processing status and data generation
  - **Test Functions Issue**: 5-second delay was insufficient for processing completion
- **Comprehensive Logging Added**:
  - Weekly digest now logs: app count, user count, emails sent, emails skipped
  - Daily engagement now logs: engagement summaries found, mentions found, unique users to process, processing progress
  - Processing function now logs: stories found, authors processed, summaries created
  - All email sending functions now report final counts
- **Fixed Weekly Digest Logic**:
  - Removed early return when no apps have vibes - emails now sent regardless
  - Added detailed console logging at every stage
  - Added counters for emails sent vs skipped
  - Better visibility into why emails might be skipped
- **Enhanced Daily User Engagement**:
  - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
  - Better tracking of processing pipeline
  - Clear visibility into data generation
  - Improved skip reason tracking
- **Improved Test Functions**:
  - Increased delay from 5 seconds to 30 seconds for daily user email test
  - Added helpful messages directing admins to check Convex logs
  - Better error handling and user feedback
- **Removed "Online/Active" Restrictions**:
  - Removed all references to not sending emails if user is "currently online/active"
  - Updated PRD documentation (`addresend.md`) to clarify emails are sent regardless of activity status
  - Ensures all eligible users receive their emails without activity-based filtering

**Technical Implementation**

- **Files Modified**:
  - `convex/emails/weekly.ts`: Added logging, removed early return, added counters
  - `convex/emails/daily.ts`: Added comprehensive logging throughout processing and sending
  - `convex/testDailyEmail.ts`: Improved test reliability with longer delays and better messaging
  - `addresend.md`: Removed online/active check references, clarified email sending behavior
- **Logging Strategy**: All email functions now log at key decision points:
  - Data fetching (how many records found)
  - User processing (how many users to email)
  - Skip reasons (why emails were skipped)
  - Final results (emails sent vs skipped)
- **No Linter Errors**: All changes verified with no TypeScript or linting issues

**Testing Instructions**

1. Check Convex logs when cron jobs run or when using admin test buttons
2. Look for log messages like:
   - "Weekly digest: Found X apps with vibes"
   - "Daily user emails: Found X engagement summaries"
   - "Processing engagement for X unique authors"
   - "Created X engagement summaries"
   - "Weekly digest complete: X emails sent, Y skipped"

### Changed

## [2024-12-XX] - User Moderation Enhancements

### Changed

- **User Moderation Dashboard**: Updated `src/components/admin/UserModeration.tsx` to display the 20 most recent users by default (increased from 15).
- **Search Functionality**: Implemented backend search across all users in `convex/users.ts` - the `listAllUsersAdmin` function now supports searching through all users by name, email, or username instead of only client-side filtering on loaded results.
- **User Profile Navigation**: Added clickable user names in the User Moderation table that navigate to user profiles.

### Technical Details

- Updated `listAllUsersAdmin` query in `convex/users.ts` to handle search queries by collecting all users and filtering server-side when a search term is provided.
- Removed client-side filtering in favor of backend search to enable searching across all users.
- Added React Router navigation support to user moderation component.
- Enhanced user experience with hover effects on clickable user names.
- Fixed user profile navigation to use username-based URLs (`/{username}`) instead of ID-based URLs (`/profile/{id}`) to match the routing system.
- Added visual feedback for users without usernames (grayed out, non-clickable).
