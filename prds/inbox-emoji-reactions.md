# Inbox Message Emoji Reactions (Simplified)

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of emoji reactions for direct messages in the inbox, allowing users to react to messages with predefined emojis similar to Apple Messages. The theme customization feature has been removed to keep the implementation simple and focused.

## Features Implemented

### Emoji Reactions

- **Predefined Emoji Set**: Users can react with 6 predefined emojis: üëç, ‚ù§Ô∏è, üòÇ, üòÆ, üò¢, üëè
- **One Reaction Per User**: Each user can only have one active reaction per message (can be changed or removed)
- **Reaction Display**: Reactions appear below messages, grouped by emoji with counts
- **Visual Feedback**: User's own reaction is highlighted with a darker background
- **Hover to React**: Smile icon appears on message hover to access reaction picker
- **Remove Reaction**: Click your own reaction to remove it

### Database Schema

**New Table: `dmReactions`**

```typescript
dmReactions: defineTable({
  messageId: v.id("dmMessages"),
  userId: v.id("users"),
  emoji: v.string(), // One of: "üëç", "‚ù§Ô∏è", "üòÇ", "üòÆ", "üò¢", "üëè"
})
  .index("by_message", ["messageId"])
  .index("by_user_message", ["userId", "messageId"]);
```

## Backend Implementation

### New File: `convex/dmReactions.ts`

**Mutations:**

- `addOrUpdateReaction`: Add or update a user's reaction (replaces existing if present)
- `removeReaction`: Remove a user's reaction from a message

**Queries:**

- `getMessageReactions`: Get all reactions for a message, grouped by emoji

### Updated: `convex/dm.ts`

Modified `listMessages` query to include reactions for each message:

```typescript
reactions: v.array(
  v.object({
    emoji: v.string(),
    count: v.number(),
    users: v.array(
      v.object({
        userId: v.id("users"),
        name: v.string(),
      }),
    ),
  }),
);
```

## Frontend Implementation

### Updated: `src/pages/InboxPage.tsx`

**New Features:**

1. Reaction picker that appears on message hover
2. Display of existing reactions below messages
3. Click handler to add/change reactions
4. Click handler to remove own reactions
5. Tooltip showing who reacted with which emoji

**UI Components:**

- Smile icon button (appears on hover)
- Reaction picker modal with 6 emoji options
- Reaction display with emoji + count bubbles
- Highlighted style for user's own reaction

## User Experience

### Adding a Reaction

1. Hover over any message in the conversation
2. Click the smile icon that appears
3. Select an emoji from the picker
4. The emoji appears below the message with your name in the tooltip

### Changing a Reaction

1. Hover over a message you've already reacted to
2. Click the smile icon
3. Select a different emoji
4. Your previous reaction is replaced

### Removing a Reaction

1. Find a message where you've added a reaction
2. Click on your reaction bubble
3. Your reaction is removed

### Viewing Who Reacted

- Hover over any reaction bubble to see names of users who reacted with that emoji
- Your own reaction has a darker background for easy identification

## Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Completed:**

- Database schema for reactions
- Backend mutations and queries
- Frontend reaction picker UI
- Reaction display below messages
- Add/update/remove reaction functionality
- Message width layout fix
- Type-safe implementation with Convex

‚ùå **Removed (simplified):**

- Emoji theme customization
- Color filters/tints for emojis
- Theme selector UI
- User preference storage for themes

## Technical Details

### Type Safety

- All validators use Convex `v.*` types
- Predefined emoji set enforced at database level
- Strong typing throughout frontend and backend

### Performance

- Indexed queries for efficient reaction lookups
- Reactions grouped on backend to minimize data transfer
- Real-time updates via Convex reactivity

### Layout

- Reactions positioned below message bubbles
- Message content maintains proper width (max-w-[70%])
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Files Modified

### Backend

- `convex/schema.ts` - Added `dmReactions` table
- `convex/dmReactions.ts` - New file with reaction logic
- `convex/dm.ts` - Updated to include reactions in message responses

### Frontend

- `src/pages/InboxPage.tsx` - Added reaction UI and interactions

### Documentation

- `changelog.MD` - Documented new feature
- `files.MD` - Added new backend file

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential features for future iterations:

- Animated reactions
- Custom emoji support
- Reaction analytics
- Bulk reaction operations
- Notification for reactions received

## Notes

This implementation focuses on core reaction functionality without theme customization, providing a clean and simple user experience similar to popular messaging apps.
