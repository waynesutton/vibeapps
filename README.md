# Vibe Apps – The place to share and discover new apps built by vibe coders.

### About

Vibe Apps is a real-time feed of apps built by vibe coders. It's where you go to show off what you've built with tools like Convex.dev, Cursor, Bolt, Windsurf, Lovable, and Tempo—and see what others are pushing live.

Powered by Convex, the site runs fast, syncs in real time, and makes it easy to:
• Submit your app
• Browse and vote on what's trending
• Leave feedback or get inspired

Whether it's a weekend build, a fresh SaaS idea, or something weird and experimental—drop it here. Vibe Apps is for developers who build in public and ship for fun.
